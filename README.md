# Talk: Web APIs from Scratch

This is a very simple example of a CRUD application using [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express), the CRUD operations are done on a JavaScript array just for example purposes, I want to do a live code with something like this on my talk about it on [#CPRO](https://campuse.ro/events/campus-party-rondonia-2018/talk/construindo-uma-api-do-0/).

There's a example of webpage which sends a POST request through a form using the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), the other actions I will use something like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com).
